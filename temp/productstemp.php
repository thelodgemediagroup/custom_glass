		<h1>Windshields</h1>
		<h3>The Clear Choice is Custom Glass Solutions by Guardian</h3>
		<p>Custom Glass Solutions is the leading producer of large format, laminated glass in North America. Our sweeping one-piece windshields add safety, style and sophistication to RVs, buses, boats, trucks, trains, tractors and more. But size isn’t everything – we also offer advanced technologies in our windshields like infrared reflective coatings that keeps unwanted heat out; acoustic glass to help mitigate NVH effects; heated glass for efficient defrosting/deicing and more.</p>

		<h1>Insulating Glass</h1>
		<h3>Insulating Glass Subhead</h3>
		<p>Insulating Glass (or glazing) is comprised of two panes of glass separated by an air or other gas filled space to reduce heat transfer. Typically used in school buses, Insulating Glass helps keep heat in during the winter and out during the summer. Insulating Glass is also used for its acoustic attenuation properties. The air or gas filled void improves the noise insulation quality and improves acoustical performance by reducing exterior noise transmission. Custom Glass Solutions has provided Insulating Glass as a “mid lite” (Insulating Glass Unit that is between the driver and the engine) for a number of niche, rear engine sports cars.</p>

		<h1>Solar Management Glass</h1>
		<h3>Solar Subhead</h3>
		<p>Controlling the heat from the sun is no easy task, but Guardian is a leader in solar management glass solutions that:
			<ul>
				<li>Create a more comfortable cabin</li>
				<li>Increase fuel efficiency</li>
				<li>Reduce emissions</li>
			</ul>
			Guardian Solar Management Glass (SMG) absorbs, reflects or blocks the sun's rays while offering superior aesthetics and styling options thanks, in part, to our complex bending capabilities. Our SMG reduces solar load by absorbing a larger portion of the sun's heat compared to standard green glass. This industry-leading technology combines maximum solar heat absorbing capabilities for applications requiring over 70% visible light transmission with standard green glass aesthetics. Formulations are available for laminated, as well as monolithic systems.

		<h1>Privacy Glass</h1>
		<h3>Privacy Glass Subhead</h3>
		<p>When you’re looking to reduce thermal load, increase privacy and enhance styling options, ask Guardian Custom Glass Solutions about privacy glass. Typically known as “tinted” glass, Guardian’s privacy glass solutions are used in glazing areas that do not have a visible light transmission requirement. Our PrivaGuard and MidNite Gray glasses exhibit outstanding heat absorbing ability with deep-tinted, neutral gray aesthetics. Being formulation based, these products are ideal in applications where high solar performance uncoated glass is required. PrivaGuard and MidNite Gray are heat treatable in monolithic applications and do not require films or coatings to meet performance requirements.</p>

		<h1>Acoustic Glass</h1>
		<h3>Acoustic Glass Subhead</h3>
		<p>Acoustic Glass typically refers to laminated glass that often utilizes a special sound absorbing PVB interlayer. In addition to absorbing the noise within the glass, Acoustic Glass also reflects noise back toward the source. In ideal circumstances, Acoustic Glass can reduce total noise by as much as 10 decibels, which means a quieter, more comfortable ride for all.</p>

		<h1>Infrared Reflective Glass</h1>
		<h3>Infrafred Reflective Glass Subhead</h3>
		<p>Guardian’s infrared reflective glass, IRR, improves fuel efficiency by keeping unwanted heat out.  Guardian IRR is a family of nano-particle thin film coated laminates that provide the highest available levels of solar energy reflection while selectively transmitting visible light. By reflecting the sun’s heat, these products achieve heat load reduction far superior to that of solar absorbing glass.</p>
		<p>The coatings can be combined with a variety of glass substrates to achieve the full range - from maximum visible transmission and solar reflectivity to privacy-type light transmission combining solar reflectivity with absorbing solutions to achieve extremely low transmission levels.</p>

			<i>Studies done by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) show that if every passenger vehicle in the United States converted to an IRR windshield, up to 10 gallons of fuel per vehicle could be saved annually or roughly 2.3 billion gallons nationwide.</i>

		<h1>Anti-Reflective Glass</h1>
		<h3>Anti-Reflective Glass Subhead</h3>
		<p>Guardian’s anti-reflective (AR) glass has a durable, multilayer, sputtered anti-reflective coating applied to our own high quality float glass. The product is economical and highly effective at reducing reflectance and enhancing transmission – a combination that enables designers and engineers to achieve optimal performance. 
			Guardian creates the AR product by vacuum depositing a multilayer anti-reflective coating developed at our Science and Technology Center onto our own high quality float glass. As the characteristics of the glass substrate are critical to overall performance, the glass itself is stringently specified and selected to ensure overall quality meets specifications desired by our customers. Automated in-line optical inspection throughout the float glass manufacturing and coating processes ensures quality, uniformity and consistency of final product. 
			Guardian AR glass is offered with a single sided coating standard and is available with a double sided coating on request. The product is offered on glass substrates up to 96” by 144” and available in high volumes.
